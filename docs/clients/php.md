# PHP Client for UmaDB

[wwwision/dcb-eventstore-umadb](https://github.com/bwaidelich/dcb-eventstore-umadb) provides an UmaDB adapter using a custom built [PHP extension](https://packagist.org/packages/wwwision/umadb-php) that uses the [Rust client](/clients/rust) via ext-php-rs.

Alternatively [wwwision/dcb-eventstore-umadb-grpc](https://github.com/bwaidelich/dcb-eventstore-umadb-grpc) can be used that is based on gRPC.

Developed and maintained by [Bastian Waidelich](https://github.com/bwaidelich).
